### ILT variable coding ###

subjn 			- participant ID
rt 			- reaction time til valid response including NaN
rt_ohne_nan 		- reaction time til vaid response without NaN
R 			- reward, 1 = rewarded, -1 = not rewarded (depends on C and rare event (p_u) --> correct 				trials only rewarded if p_u = 0)
C			- correct (chosing card with 70% win probability), 1 = correct, 0 = incorrect
A			- choice (chosen card), 1 = card 2, 2 = card 1
a_side			- choice left / right, 1 = left, 2 = right
random_lr		- card 1 or 2 on left or right, 1 = card 1 on left, 2 = card 1 on right
MRI			- number of scanner in Berlin
vers_ord		- order of card pairs, 1 = A-B, 2 = B-A
ord			- order of reinforcer type, 1 = S-A, 2 = A-S
Drink_Type		- alcohol or juice block, A = alcohol, J = juice
chosen_A		- chosen alcoholic drink, W = white wine, L = limoncello, c = campari orange, R = red wine, f = fruit liquor
chosen_J		- chosen non-alcoholic drink, A = apple, O = orange, N = pineapple, T = grape, M = multivitamin
rating.taste1		- taste rating before block
rating.crave1		- craving rating before block
rating.taste2		- taste rating before block
rating.crave2		- craving rating before block
state 			- determines which card is the better one (but 1 does not mean card 1 is better)
				--> new_state randomly chosen based on state 
				--> new_state = Z.state = S
				--> S = 2: card 1 is better in 70%
				--> S = 1: card 2 is better in 70%
