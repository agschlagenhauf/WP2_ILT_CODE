- state = determines which card is the better one (but 1 does not mean card 1 is better)
	
	--> new_state randomly chosen based on state 
	--> new_state = Z.state = S
	--> S = 2: card 1 is better in 70%
	--> S = 1: card 2 is better in 70%
- A = which card was chosen (1 for card 2, 2 for card 1)
- C (correct) depends on whether chosen card = randomly chosen state
- R (rewarded) depends on C and rare event (p_u) --> correct trials only rewarded if p_u = 0
